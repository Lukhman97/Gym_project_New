🎯 𝐏𝐔𝐑𝐏𝐎𝐒𝐄 𝐎𝐅 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐉𝐄𝐂𝐓

The GymTracker App is a Python Full Stack web application developed using Django (REST Framework) for the backend and React.js for the frontend.
The primary goal of this project is to digitize gym management workflows by providing a secure, role-based, and scalable system for managing gym operations.

This application is designed to simulate a real-world production environment, where different users interact with the system based on their assigned roles.

💡 𝐖𝐇𝐘 𝐆𝐘𝐌𝐓𝐑𝐀𝐂𝐊𝐄𝐑 ?

Traditional gym management relies heavily on manual tracking, spreadsheets, or disconnected tools.
GymTracker solves this problem by offering:

• Centralized gym data management
• Clear role separation (Admin / Trainer / User)
• Secure authentication using JWT tokens
• Structured data flow using REST APIs
• Scalable backend and responsive frontend
